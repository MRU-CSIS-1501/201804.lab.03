# Lab-03

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Well. to be honest?

Giving you some time to catch up.

Ideally, by the end of this 50 minutes, you will have:

- activated your Piazza account
- created a Github account **and started watching the assignment 2 docs**
- added the strip spaces thing I mentioned on Blackboard to your .emacs file
- taken a look at the docs for assignment 2
- worked through at least one REPL drill (and hopefully started another)

## YOUR SKILL DRILLS

The following are due by 9AM on October 2nd:
